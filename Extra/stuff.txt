Ok, can you tell me what modifications I would need to make to the code so that a user can input text (yes or no) to indicate their answer?



Ok, I want to make it in the backend such that every 



I want to create a mern app where there is a questionnaire hardcoded in the frontend where the user can type yes or no in  a text field for their answer. The questions are numbered from 1 to 10  and there is a database of recommendations with ids from 1 to 10 . I want to set it up so that if a user says yes to an answer then a recommendation for that answer is brought back and if a user types no for a recommendation then the recommendation for that answer is not brought in. How do I do that

Recommendation

The numbers for each question corresponds to the number(num) variable of each recommendation, so I also want you to modify the backend code such that if the user answered no to  a question, the recommendation with the corresponding number is shown but if the user answered yes to the question,  the recommendation with the corresponding number is not  shown, for example if the answer to question 1 is no then the recommendation with number 1 is returned and if the answer for question 2 is yes then the recommendation with the number 2 (it's recommendation) is not shown, and so on and so on

The numbers for next to the questionnaire correspond to the numbers (num) values  of the recommendations


Ok, Can you modify the code for the questionnaire  such that a user is able to enter yes or no text that indicates their answer.  I want to the code to send back the answers for the questions  to the backend. I want each variable that captures the answer of a question to have a naming scheme that corresponds to the number of the question, for example, the variable answer for question 1 would be ans1 and the variable fo answer for question 2 would be ans2.
In the backend  


 such that when I modify the code such that when y, for example if answer 1 is yes then the recommendation for 1 pops up but if the answer for 2 is no then it's recommendation is not shown, and so on and so on

Ok, can you modify the code such that when a  response is returned from the database, we are moved to a new page and that page displays the objects gotten from the database

Yeah you were right that was the problem, can you modify the code to loop through all the objects?

export default cobitResultsSlice.reducer;



Is there a way to store the number used in the variable along with the response i.e.   ans1  could store the answer yes and also store the number 1,  ans2  could store the answer no and also store the number 2?





Ok, could you modify the code so that each answer variable is an object hat contains both the number representing the question and the answer?  for example ans1 could contain the number 1 and the answer 'no' and ans2 could contain the number 2 and the answer 'yes' 
is there any that for example ans1 could be an object that contains both the number representing the question and the answer?
